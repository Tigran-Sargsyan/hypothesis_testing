# Hypothesis testing

We take the seconds spent during the specific intervals in the blitz game (3 minutes per game) of chess. Since the time is measured in a single game, our data is paired. Using hypothesis testing we want to analyze on which interval does the player spend more time and give a hint on which part of his/her game the player has to work more thoroughly.
